'''You work with large data sets in Python, and typically, 
the data arrive sorted within individual batches but not 
across all batches. You are given n lists, where each list 
is sorted in ascending order. The function should return a 
single list consisting of all elements from all lists, 
sorted in ascending order.

The time complexity of your solution should be O(nâ‹…m), 
where n is the total number of lists and m is the maximum 
length of any list.

Your solution is not allowed to use built-in functions like 
sorted, sort, or additional libraries like heapq.'''
