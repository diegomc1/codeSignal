'''You are given an array of n integers. Your task is to return the number 
of unique elements in the array â€” an element is unique if it appears only 
once in the array. You cannot use any built-in Python functions to achieve this.

For example, count_unique_elements([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]) = 3, as there are four 
unique elements in the list - 1, 3, and 4.'''
