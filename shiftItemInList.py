'''In this problem, you are given a list of n integers. Additionally, 
you are given an integer shift, which represents the number of 
positions each element in the list should be moved.

Your task is to create a Python function that should shift every
 element in the list to the right (for a positive shift) or to the
   left (for a negative shift) by shift positions. The shift should
 be circular â€” the last element should be moved to the start of the
 list if shift is positive, and vice versa.

Please implement this without the usage of any built-in functions
 of Python to shift, sort, or move items in the list.
 Your solutions efficiency should be O(n).'''
